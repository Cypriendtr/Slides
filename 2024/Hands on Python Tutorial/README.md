![BrainHack 2024 logo](./fig/brainhack.png)

This folder contains all the support used for the Hands on python tutorial at the BrainHack 2024 edition.
Here you will find all the slides, the tutorial notebooks and the requierements.txt file with all the Python libraries.

## Program:
For this 2 hours BrainHack session we have planned a very ambitious programme.

### Beginning:
We will start by providing you a complete environment to code in Python, either on your own machine with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) or with [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com) servers  using files from this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h1xRtSA7tzuJkmp5fEmwCrM-eCOecMRm?usp=sharing). As the download of your own Python environment may take a while, we will in parallel do an introduction to present the role and interests of Python, coupled with a small poll as an icebreaker to know a bit better eachother.

### The tutorial:
In this tutorial we will delve (as deep as we can in two hours) into Python programming. We'll provide and show you how and where to write code. 
We will in this order present you:
* The different variables
* How to perfom calculus
* How to deal with multiple variables
* Introduction to `Function` in Python and condition to automate code
* How to upgrade your code with libraries
* How to import data & perfom some visualisation + analysis

Finally if some of you are interested in pursuing the learning and are willing to switch to Python for their lab analysis we propose for the following days to help you on this journey. Get ready to code !
